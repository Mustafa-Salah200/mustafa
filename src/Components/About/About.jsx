      <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Currenty persuing a degree in Software Engeneering , I decided to pursue my passion for programming. I enrolled in free coding cources and learned full-stack web development. My favorite part of programming is the problem-solving aspect. I love the feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack is React and Next.js. I am also familiar with TypeScript, Prisma, Node.js, and MongoDB.. I am always looking to learn new technologies.</p>
